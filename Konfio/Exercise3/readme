The idea for this exercise is to create various services with terraform and terragrunt. Suppose I have a directory called devops and inside it we will have several subfolders as described below.

why-we-use-terragrunt ?

the initial purpose of Terragrunt was to fill in a few gaps in Terraformâ€™s functionality, and it has continuously expanded with new features. Although Terraform has evolved to support more advanced feature sets, it still has room for improvement. Only Terragrunt brings the following rich feature set to the table:

Explicit dependencies: Share your state easily
Automatic Atlantis config generation: Eliminates toil
Environment variable support: Discourages hard-coded values
Generateblocks: Remove repeated Terraform
Automatic resource tagging: Applies metadata universally
Arbitrary command output from variables: Streamlines library usage
read_terragrunt_configimports: Eliminate repeated Terragrunt code
